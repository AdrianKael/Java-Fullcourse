This is not the same as Overload of Methods, Overwrite of methods is called when we have more classes involved

example:
    Animal: (Father)
        Attributes: none
        Methods: eat();
    Person: (Children)
        Attributes: none
        Methods: eat();
    Dog: (Children)
        Attributes: none
        Methods: eat();
    Cow: (Children)
        Attributes: none
        Methods: eat();
